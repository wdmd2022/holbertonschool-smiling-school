# Implement a Design from Scratch -- in BOOTSTRAP!

## just kidding, we are implementing three!

- Your styles.css must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes

## Notes about interactions:

= Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9

## Technologies Used
